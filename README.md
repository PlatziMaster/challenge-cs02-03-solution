# PS03: Algorithm Design Techniques

This series of problems aim to test your problem solving techniques by practicing and using
the techniques usually found in sorting algorithms.

# How to submit.

* Visit each folder `01, 02, 03` and follow the instructions.
* As always, all code will be checked for readability using [**pylint**](https://www.pylint.org/).
* A grader is included in every problem, and all test cases must pass.

# Debugging

* You can run each problem's grader using python and piping the desired test case.
