# Next president!

Given an array **V** of vote decisions, return the winner of the election.
You are guaranteed to have a winner. Also, you can assume the winner have more than
`floor(n/2)` votes in favor.

### Example

* **Input**: `[1,2,3,1,1,2,5,1,1]`
* **Output**: `1`
* **Explanation**: Candidate `1` had 5 votes in favor, candidate `2` had 2, and candidate
`3` and `5` had 1.

# How to submit:

Complete the function `winner(V)` in `solution.py`

Can you solve it without using auxiliary data structures and without modifying **V**?
